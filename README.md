# MyLinks

## Important!
This is a hobby project. Currently, there is no production version that would be executable!
I use this project to try out new things and to refresh and expand my skills.

You want to support me? I'd love to! Get in touch with me!

## Overview

I have repeatedly come across various service providers on the internet who offer a small "homepage" to share my social links.

At events, you see more and more people wearing a badge with a QR code printed on it. Some can even send data directly to other people's mobile phones via NFC.

I thought this is a great idea.

That's how the idea of my own app "MyLinks" (currently still a project name. I am still looking for a real name) was born.
